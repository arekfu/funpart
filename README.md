funpart - FUNctional PARTicle transport
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arekfu/funpart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arekfu/funpart)

`funpart` is a toolkit for Monte-Carlo simulations for particle transport in
Haskell. It is vaguely inspired by Geant4 and TRIPOLI-4Â®. It is really supposed
to be:

1. A demonstrator for scientific computation in Haskell;
2. An easily extensible tool to make it possible to quickly test a new
   transport algorithm, variance-reduction method, etc.;
3. A sandbox to play around and learn more Haskell in a realistic setting
   (that's the fun part -- pun intended).

It is *not* (yet) supposed to be:

1. A realistic alternative to existing particle-transport codes;
2. A tool for world domination.
